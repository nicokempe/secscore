## Description

This Security Score Proof of Concept is a lightweight Nuxt + Nitro web app that lets you paste any CVE ID and returns a time-aware threat score (SecScore) enriched with public signals (NVD, EPSS, CISA KEV, ExploitDB, OSV). After reading the paper [SecScore: Enhancing the CVSS Threat Metric Group with Empirical Evidences](https://arxiv.org/abs/2405.08539) and searching for an open, usable proof-of-concept I could not find one that matched the paper‚Äôs approach or my practical needs, so I decided to build this PoC to experiment with the model, combine it with real public feeds, and adapt the scoring and UX for realistic vulnerability prioritization. The project intentionally avoids a database (using Nitro caching and routeRules), exposes a simple UI and API, and keeps the model, parameters and evidence fully transparent for reproducible research and extension.

## Features

- üîç Enter any CVE ID and get an instant SecScore with current threat context
- üåê Powered only by public data sources: NVD, EPSS, CISA KEV, OSV, and ExploitDB
- ‚ö° Lightweight design ‚Äî no database, just Nitro caching and smart route rules
- üìä Combines CVSS base metrics with exploit probability and real-world signals
- üìù Transparent explanations show why a CVE is prioritized (PoC found, KEV flag, EPSS score)
- üé® Clean and intuitive Nuxt frontend for quick lookups and demos
- üß© Fully open-source, easy to extend with additional APIs or custom scoring logic

## Development Guide

This project is built with **Nuxt 3 + Nitro** and uses **pnpm** as the package manager.

### Prerequisites

- [Node.js 22+](https://nodejs.org/en/)
- [pnpm](https://pnpm.io/) installed globally:
  ```bash
  corepack enable
  corepack prepare pnpm@latest --activate
  ```

### Setup

Install all dependencies:

```bash
pnpm install
```

### Development Server

Start the development server on [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000):

```bash
pnpm dev
```

Hot module replacement (HMR) is enabled, so changes are applied instantly.

### Production

Build the application for production:

```bash
pnpm build
```

Preview the production build locally:

```bash
pnpm preview
```

### Deployment

Nuxt/Nitro supports multiple deployment targets (Node, serverless, edge, etc.).
Refer to the [Nuxt Deployment Docs](https://nuxt.com/docs/getting-started/deployment) for configuration.
